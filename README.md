# SwapNet

Research Paper : SwapNet: Image Based Garment Transfer: http://www.eye.gatech.edu/swapnet/paper.pdf


I tried to implement SwapNet based on the information I collected from the paper, I could not train the model since it require a very powerful GPU but I tried to make it simple and easy to understand to that anyone can run and test it on their machine ! Let me know if you need any kind of help understanding the code.
